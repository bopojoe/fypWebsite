# fypWebsite

This was meant to be the front-end of the application "A View to the past"

The upload feature was tested and worked to upload the Reality file to the required bucket, making it available to donload via the application.

As the failed to work in the application. this side of the project was abandoned and the database features removed from the app.

This made the Front-end of the project redundant and now has no purpose.

The upload does still work but as the rest of the data needed to run the application ion the iOS side is not there, priorities were set to get the iOS side working in some fashion before the website was finished.
